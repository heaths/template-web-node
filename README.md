# Static Web Template

This is a template for a simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) application serving static files to help teach my children web design and programming. You can use this in a repository named `<username>.github.io` to host a static site using [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages).

## Setup

1. Create new repository from template, ideally named `<username>.github.io`. You can also click <https://github.com/heaths/template-web-node/generate>.
2. Run `npm install` to install required modules.
3. In [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), press `Ctrl+F5` to launch without debugging, or run `node server.js`.

You can modify *index.html*, and add new directories and files to serve static content without restarting the server.
